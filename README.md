# Gumshoe: A simple rewrite of Sleuth by 

Sleuth is a classic DOS game by Eric N. Miller. You can play it online various places, including The Internet Archive's DOS Games Archive: [sleuth - A Murder Mystery](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Sleuth_-_A_Murder_Mystery_1983).

It started as a fairly faithful recreation, but will likely morph into a more complex puzzle game over time. It's currently got a few issues.

This is (at least so far) almost 100% vibe coded. I've done a couple small bugfixes manually, but I'm mostly usiung Claude Code. (It's working much better than my first vibe coding attempt of a...spatial reasoning puzzle. "Hey, Claude, can you implement the ARC2 challenge as a game?" is unsurprisingly *not* the LLM's strong suit.)

Anyway, you can view the deployed app at https://gumshoe.lkbm.workers.dev/
